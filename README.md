**Cloud** and **DevOps engineer** by craft, **software builder** by curiosity. I design automation pipelines, optimize cloud infrastructure, and turn emerging tech into reliable, production-ready systems. My focus is on **reliability and velocity** by building internal platforms that help teams ship faster, safer, and with more confidence. I like shaping the *quiet parts of engineering*: the CI/CD pipelines that just work, the dashboards that tell the truth, and the systems that stay calm under pressure.

Over the past five years, Iâ€™ve worked across **on-prem and cloud environments** using AWS, Cloudflare, and bare-metal servers. I enjoy tuning Go services for performance, automating releases with PowerShell, and building developer tools that make life simpler.  

When Iâ€™m not on the clock, youâ€™ll find me in my **HomeLab**, experimenting with `Caddy` proxies, `MinIO` storage, or `Jellyfin` servers that occasionally hum louder than they should. I like blending **technology with design**, keeping everything functional, clear, and visually calm. Curiosity keeps me learning, and craftsmanship keeps me honest.

#### ðŸ§  Learning & Building

- Exploring **Rust** to understand systems at a lower level and build high-performance tools  
- Diving into **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to experiment with local and personal AI assistants  
- Building **CLI-focused tools in Go** that make everyday engineering tasks faster and cleaner  
- Restructuring and documenting my **HomeLab servers** for better reliability and organization  
- Continuously refining my **developer workflow** across terminals, editors, and automation setups  


#### ðŸš§ My Open Source projects in progress

- [**ASKY**](https://github.com/patppuccin/asky) - Simple interactive prompt library for Go.
- [**VIEWR**](https://github.com/patppuccin/asky) - A simple, local-first, read-only file browser
- [**TERMICOLR**](https://github.com/patppuccin/termicor) - Lightweight terminal theming package for Go CLI apps.

#### ðŸŽ® When Away From Work

- I explore **architecture** and design in both physical and digital forms  
- I enjoy creating **pixel and voxel art**, building small detailed worlds  
- I relax with **movies and games**, recently playing *Assassinâ€™s Creed Odyssey*  
- I often code late at night while listening to **ambient soundtracks**

  <summary><b>ðŸ§­ My Engineering Philosophy</b></summary>

  I began as a **biotechnologist**, fascinated by how life organizes itself. Over time, that curiosity shifted toward **how systems and machines work**. What started as curiosity turned into a lifelong pursuit. I experimented, broke things, fixed them, and learned why they failed.  

  I learned by **doing, failing, and rebuilding** until things made sense. That trial-and-error mindset shaped how I approach software and systems today. I believe engineering is not about perfection but about **iteration, clarity, and feedback**.

  I like to **move fast but understand what I break**. Every tool, every script, every system is a way to think better and build better. The goal is not just to ship software but to **keep learning** and **create things that endure**.
