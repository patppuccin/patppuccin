I’m a **DevOps & Cloud Engineer** currently at *Caplin Point Laboratories*, building automation systems and internal platforms that keep things running quietly and efficiently. I enjoy writing in Go and Python to make systems stable and engineers happy. With experience across cloud, edge, and hybrid environments using AWS, Cloudflare, and on-prem setups, I spend my nights in my homelab tuning Caddy proxies, MinIO storage, Jellyfin servers, and whatever else is blinking at 2 AM. I like blending technology with design, keeping things functional, clean, and visually calm.

#### 📚 Some of my recent musings

<!-- MUSINGS-LIST:START -->
<!-- MUSINGS-LIST:END -->

#### 🏠 Homelab Life

🖥️  A calm cluster of Ubuntu + Windows nodes, reverse-proxied by **Caddy + Cloudflare**  
📦  Services: MinIO, Syncthing, Jellyfin, internal dashboards  
💾  Drives with personality — `Arca` (5 TB HDD) and `Cista` (1 TB SSD)  
🧩  Each machine has a Greek-Latin name, because naming is half the fun  

#### 🧠 Learning & Building

- High-performance Go CLIs with personality  
- Zig + MuPDF for native PDF processing  
- Local MCP servers for offline AI integrations  
- Tailwind v4 + Svelte component systems  
- Structuring digital gardens that *feel* human  

#### 🎮 When Away From Work

- Designing pixel-art scenes & homelab dashboards  
- Playing **Stardew Valley**, **Factorio**, or **No Man’s Sky**  
- Customizing my PowerShell + Starship setup (again)  
- Listening to ambient scores while coding into the night
